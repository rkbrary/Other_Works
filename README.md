# Other_Works

In this repo, you may find all the small work I've been doing in python.

dumb_algo.py and greedy_algo.py are algorithms trying to solve different optimization problems.

"dumb" refers to the fact that it just tests all the possibilities, which will generally take a lot (too much) time, but will always find the global optimal solution.
"greedy" refers to the fact that it finds the locally optimal solution at each step. It takes a very decent computational time, but will not always converge, unless some known assumptions (ex: matro√Ødes).

Encrypt.py contains some basic cryptography algorithms.
